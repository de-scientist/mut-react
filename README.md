## 🧭 Design Philosophy

This website follows a **structured leadership-first approach**:

* Every leadership page follows the same flow:

  1. Hero Section
  2. Leader Profile
  3. About the Office / Ministry
  4. Roles & Responsibilities
  5. Call-to-Action

* Language is **formal, mission-aligned, and constitution-aware**

* Visual hierarchy emphasizes **clarity over decoration**

This ensures consistency, credibility, and long-term maintainability.
