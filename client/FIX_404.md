# Fix for api.js 404 Error

## Problem
Browser is trying to load `/src/services/api.js` but the file is now `api.ts`

## Solution

### Step 1: Clear Vite Cache (Already Done)
```bash
# Vite cache has been cleared
```

### Step 2: Restart Dev Server
**IMPORTANT**: You must restart the Vite dev server for the changes to take effect.

1. **Stop the current dev server** (Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running)

2. **Restart it**:
   ```bash
   cd mut-react
   npm run dev
   ```

### Step 3: Clear Browser Cache
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
   OR
4. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete` and clear cached images and files

### Step 4: Verify
After restarting:
- Check that `api.ts` is being loaded (not `api.js`)
- The error should be gone

## Why This Happened
- We converted `api.js` to `api.ts` 
- Vite's dev server cached the old `.js` reference
- Browser also cached the old module reference
- Restarting clears both caches

## If Still Not Working
1. Check `src/services/api.ts` exists ✅
2. Verify imports use `'../services/api'` (no extension) ✅
3. Restart dev server
4. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
